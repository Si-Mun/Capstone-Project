* Make the copy of Build Model.ipynb on the colab, and then run it normally
* If want to run it locally, there are several steps to doing it:
  1. Install Anaconda Navigator
  2. Clone the repository
  3. Make sure all important libraries are already installed
  4. If there are some libraries that haven't been installed, use the command pip install "libraryName" on the Anaconda command prompt
