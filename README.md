## Build Machine Learning Model using Transfer Learning Inception V3 ##

* Make the copy of Build Model.ipynb on the colab, and then run it normally
* If want to run it locally, there are several steps to doing it:
  1. Install Anaconda Navigator
  2. Make sure all important libraries are already installed
  3. If there are some libraries that haven't been installed, use the command pip install "libraryName" on the Anaconda command prompt
  4. Make sure all paths already changed to the folder you want saved to
